# Event-Driven Rails demo
This is a demo for the talk I delivered at Geekle Ruby on Rails Global Summit 2023

## Installation
1. Clone repo
2. Run `bundle install`
3. Run `rails db:migrate && rails db:seed`

## Usage
You can switch users in the top-right. 
Authors can write articles and see all drafts. 
Readers just see published articles.

You can view all events at the `/res` endpoint.
